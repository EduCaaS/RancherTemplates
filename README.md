Opensaas Rancher Templates
=====

This is a testing ground for our [Rancher](http://rancher.com/) templates before moving them to the [community catalog](https://github.com/OpenSaasAU/community-catalog)

[See this doc for instructions on how to add a custom catalog to rancher](http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.2/en/catalog/)

####Note
The templates here are under development and are changing often and may break at anytime.
